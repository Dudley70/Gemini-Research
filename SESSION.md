## WHERE WE ARE

**Current Task:** Project initialization and foundation setup

**Status:** Setting up repository structure, git initialization, creating foundational documentation

**Context:** New repository to enable cross-LLM collaboration on Gemini research prompt engineering. Based on proven Gemini Research Method but enhanced for universal LLM accessibility.

  - Reorganized References by path
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:05 - Configured GitHub remote (Dudley70/Gemini-Research)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:05 - Created directory structure (docs/ hierarchy)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:05 - Created .gitignore (macOS, Python, IDE exclusions)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:05 - Created docs/INDEX.md (documentation tracking)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:05 - Created README.md (repository overview)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:10 - Reviewed ChatGPT v1.3.0 pack
  - Moved to docs/analysis/chatgpt_v1.3.0_pack/
  - Read core files (README, RESEARCH_FRAME_GUIDE, CUSTOM_GPT_INSTRUCTIONS, BLUEPRINT)
  - Understood complementary nature (generator vs documentation)
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:10 - Created chatgpt_approach_analysis.md
  - Compared both approaches
  - Identified integration opportunities
  - Provided recommendations
  - Updated docs/INDEX.md
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:15 - Initial commit and push to GitHub
  - Committed 17 files (1,348 insertions)
  - Pushed to origin/main successfully
  - Repository live at: https://github.com/Dudley70/Gemini-Research
- [x] 2025-11-13 23:20 - Corrected understanding of ChatGPT pack
  - **Key Discovery:** ChatGPT's pack and our methodology are SIBLING implementations
  - Both derived from the same two source papers
  - ChatGPT added template types, Custom GPT automation
  - Neither branch is complete - source papers are authoritative
  - Updated chatgpt_approach_analysis.md to reflect sibling status
  - Updated PROJECT.md Decision Log (Decision #003)
  - Updated References section to show source papers as foundation

---

## NEXT STEPS

**PRIORITY 1: Review Source Papers**
1. **Read source papers directly** (most important)
   - Gemini Pro Prompting Capability Assessment.md
   - Gemini Prompting Capability Self-Assessment.md
   - These are the authoritative foundation for everything
   - Verify both branches captured all insights
   - Identify gaps in both implementations

**Then: Reconcile and Enhance**
2. **Document source paper insights** in docs/reference/
3. **Cross-pollinate between branches:**
   - Extract ChatGPT's template types → adapt for our templates
   - Extract our PATH 1/2 distinction → inform ChatGPT approach
   - Combine Gate 0 Preflight with our quality gates
4. **Port and enhance Web UI materials**
   - 01_PRINCIPLES.md → docs/methodology/principles/
   - 02_TEMPLATES.md → docs/methodology/templates/
   - Enhance with insights from both branches + source papers
5. **Create bridge documentation**
   - docs/enhancements/unified_methodology.md
   - Show how both branches complement each other
   - Provide hybrid approach examples
6. **Create LLM guides**
   - docs/guides/for_chatgpt.md
   - docs/guides/for_claude.md

## CONTEXT RECOVERY

**If returning to this project:**
1. Read PROJECT.md Strategic Context section
2. Review this SESSION.md for current state
3. Check git log for recent changes
4. Review docs/INDEX.md for documentation map

**Key Understanding:**
- Purpose: Enable any LLM to generate effective Gemini research prompts
- Foundation: Two source papers (Gemini capability assessments)
- **Critical:** ChatGPT pack and our methodology are SIBLING implementations from same source
- Goal: Reconcile both branches and create unified cross-platform framework
- Source: `/Users/dudley/Projects/Gemini Research Method/`
- **Critical:** Two distinct paths - PATH 1 (Web UI copy/paste - PRIMARY) vs PATH 2 (API automation - SECONDARY)
